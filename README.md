# BelleCartographieTGC
Graphic submod for Victoria's TGC Overhaul Mod

Credits to https://www.moddb.com/mods/belle-cartographie/downloads/belle-cartographie-v01 rascalnag for base mod

Contains: BC's flat political map adjusted for TGC, as TGC has an entirely different map from vanilla/HFM/HPM/etc

Added thicker national borders from PastelThickMod (which you can also find on my git)

Contains partial endonym's localization for country names, use at will, delete it if you prefer basic names 



If you prefer lighter ocean colour, copy water.fx from main folder to gfx/FX and overwrite. Default version contains dark sea
